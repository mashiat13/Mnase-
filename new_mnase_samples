Computational analysis:
1. FastQC - reports look good. No major overrepresented adaptor sequences. 

2. Mapping using bowtie

#-b-Output in the BAM format.
#-S-Ignored for compatibility with previous samtools versions. Previously this option was required if input was in SAM format, but now the correct format is automatically detected by examining the first few characters of input.
#-u-Output uncompressed BAM. This option saves time spent on compression/decompression and is thus preferred when the output is piped to another samtools command.
#@ -Set number of sorting and compression threads. By default, operation is single-threaded.



4. Convert bam to bed 

5. Run Fseq2
