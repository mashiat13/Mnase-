Title - Mnase analysis 
Core ID: 3462-MR

Sequencing specifics:
- NovaSeq shared flowcell - generated from 151 x 151 NovaSeq
This pool was subjected to 151bp paired-end sequencing according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol (Illumina NovaSeq). Bcl2fastq2 Conversion Software (Illumina) was used to generate de-multiplexed Fastq files.
- expected reads per sample on average - 20 million 
- Sample details:

#-b-Output in the BAM format.
#-S-Ignored for compatibility with previous samtools versions. Previously this option was required if input was in SAM format, but now the correct format is automatically detected by examining the first few characters of input.
#-u-Output uncompressed BAM. This option saves time spent on compression/decompression and is thus preferred when the output is piped to another samtools command.
#@ -Set number of sorting and compression threads. By default, operation is single-threaded.



4. Convert bam to bed 

5. Run Fseq2
